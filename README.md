## What?

This will show your exact age ( in nano years ) to you, everytime you open a new-tab. Yes, this will replace your currently new-tab page, but who does need it?

( *update to an already-exsisted add-on [Lifetime](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lifetime/).* )

## Why?

Because it wasn't compatible with FireFox Quantum. Additionally, it was experimental for me to make an add-on.

## How?

Scratched with the brand-new [WebExtension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) language ( okay, maybe that was too much! ).

## How to start development?

Have you already cloned the project? ( xD )

Well, then run these commands

`npm install`

`gulp`

You're all set, just need to use something like `web-ext run` to pop this add-on on a development enviroment.
