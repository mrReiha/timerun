## What?

This will show your exact age ( based on multiple units of your choice ) to you, every time you open a new tab. Yes, this will replace your currently new tab page, but who does need it?

I've found it more productive to get notified about my age each and every day.

## Why?

To keep you focused. to remind you how much your time is valuable. as a motivation lever.

## How?

This makes you feel it deeply how time is passing by so quickly. and as result, you will have more energy and motivation.

Scratched with the brand-new [WebExtension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) language ( okay, maybe that was too much! ).

## How to start development?

Have you already cloned the project? ( xD )

Well, then run these commands

```
npm install
```

```
gulp
```

You're all set, just need to use something like `web-ext run` to pop this add-on on a development environment.
