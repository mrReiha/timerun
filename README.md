> This is develop branch which is not stable at all. Whole new features ( even those were in the middle of development ) are available here. Consider installing through [Mozilla add-on manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/timerun/).

## How to start development?

Have you already cloned the project? ( xD )

Well, then run these commands

```
npm install
```

```
gulp
```

You're all set, just need to use something like `web-ext run` to pop this add-on on a development environment.
